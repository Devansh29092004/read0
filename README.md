# README Maker

## Description

README Maker is a simple tool designed to help developers and project creators generate professional and consistent README files for their projects. The app offers an intuitive interface where users can input details such as project title, description, features, installation instructions, technologies used, and more, which it then compiles into a ready-to-use markdown README file.
